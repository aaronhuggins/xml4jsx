# XML for JSX

A server-side tool for rendering JSX components to XML.

## Usage

Works with React, Preact, and Nano JSX.

See the examples in the `./examples` folder for how to use the library.

## Your favorite JSX renderer not working?

Most libraries seem to prefer either React's or Preact's APIs. If your favorite JSX library provides server side rendering and it's not working with this library, please open an issue and reference a code example that you think should work.
